# Exercise-logreg-and-ROC-curve
* Use the HTRU2 dataset as the experimental dataset for this exercise.   
You may download HTRU2 from:  
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2  
Separate the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing data
* Implement the “logreg_sgd” function with L1 regularization  
* Implement the “plot_roc_curve” function
